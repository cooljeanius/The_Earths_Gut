+#. since this is the first string to get put into the potfile, a general translation note:
+#. The original author of this campaign (Anonymissimus) was a native/primary speaker of German.
+#. If a particular phrase doesn't make sense in English, try to imagine what the German original
+#. might have been, and then translate from that instead.
+#. Also, a note about the title: "The Earth's Gut" is a poetic way of saying "Deep in the Earth";
+#. if you are localizing the title in translation, it doesn't need to literally be "gut" but rather
+#. can be some other form of poetic/figurative speaking that makes more sense in your language:
