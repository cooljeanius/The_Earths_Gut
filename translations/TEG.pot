#. since this is the first string to get put into the potfile, a general translation note:
#. The original author of this campaign (Anonymissimus) was a native/primary speaker of German.
#. If a particular phrase doesn't make sense in English, try to imagine what the German original
#. might have been, and then translate from that instead.
#. Also, a note about the title: "The Earth's Gut" is a poetic way of saying "Deep in the Earth";
#. if you are localizing the title in translation, it doesn't need to literally be "gut" but rather
#. can be some other form of poetic/figurative speaking that makes more sense in your language:

#. this description string is broken in two by interpolation of the required version;
#. an example of how it would be put together would be:

"It is 515YW and you are Hamel, a young dwarven leader. Your tribe resides in the Knalga caverns near the Dwarven Doors and is constantly under threat of attack. Resources are also becoming scarce in your area, so you must guide your people on a quest for more minerals. With the new minerals you will be able to forge new weapons and armor to push back your enemies.\n"
"The campaign focuses on 'dwarvish dungeon crawling', and the developer intention is to make it playable for newbies on easy while also keeping it challenging for experienced players on hard. (Beginner level, 23 scenarios (nearly finished, but not quite))\n"
