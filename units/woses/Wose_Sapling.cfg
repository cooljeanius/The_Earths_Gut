    description= _ "Rarely seen, even by elves, a Wose is a type of creature about which little is known. The elves are the most abundant source of knowledge about them; they know that despite the similarities in form, the Woses are not descended from trees. Woses are more closely tied to the faerie world than the elves are, though in a different way. The Woses' motives and workings are unknown, though most agree on a common theory that they are wardens of the natural world.

Woses are extremely peaceful, but possess great strength. They are neither used to moving around, nor are they quick at it."
